- Adrian Hausmann
- Stefan Caminada

## About the Project
### Schedule
> **26.11.2022**: Start<br>
> **17.12.2022**: Interim Presentation<br>
> **18.01.2023**: Deadline<br>

### Goals
The main task is to implement a small machinelearning model and get it to production. Important/assessed parts are: 
- A program which predicts something (this is not really important it just has to work)
- Clean and readable python Code
- Working in a team
- GIT Releasemanagement
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Cloud deployment (e.g. Goodle Cloud)

    - Stefan Caminada
        Initiate GIT Repo on GITHub
        Frontend --> Backend Interface (REST) with FLASK
    - Roman Sonder
        Find a Dataset 
        Build a model (write a prediction Method for unseen data)
    - Adrian Hausmann
        Start Teams Group for Communication
        Draft for presentation
        Check how to use CI/CD (Google Cloud)
- Scheduled next teammeeting for 2022.11.27 13:30-14:30 with the following agenda:
